# B-Minor Lexer
## How to use 
- generate a file that contains B-Minor codes that you want to compile against the lexer (like ```example.b```).
- change the file path variable in ```main.c```.
- execute ```main.c```. 

> I also upload a B-Minor pdf for those wanna know about B-Minor like its syntax, semantics, etc.
