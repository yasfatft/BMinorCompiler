# BMinorCompiler
A self implementation of compiler of BMinor programming language
## how to use 
it's so easily!!
- make a file that contains B-Minor codes that you want to compile
- change the variable named path in main.c file

this isn't already a completed project and i will update it normally suring time until becoming a B-Minor advanced compiler. wheras it's now only a lexer of language B-Minor :|
